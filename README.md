Tor is a free and open source software for enabling anonymous communication by bouncing your internet traffic around a network of relays all over the world. It protects against network surveillance and traffic analysis, and helps people in repressive regimes circumvent censorship.

I personally run some high bandwidth relays and encourage you to run one as well if you are able to. You will be helping to increase the overall security of the network.
